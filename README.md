Mentoring-Groups-Assessment
===========================

This assessment will give us a chance to get to know you, your skill level and understand what you're hoping to accomplish. It will also help us choose the material for our mentoring sessions. We are focusing on female developers who are at an intermediate or senior level, so if you fall in that category show us what you got :)

The final output is three HTML pages that will give us information on which mentoring group you would like to join, why you would like to join and what you are excited to learn about.

Our assessment will require you to do the following:

    Setup a development environment of your choice
    Create a GitHub account and page if you don't already have one
    Create 3 basic HTML5 pages and style them with basic CSS
    Use basic command line to navigate and manage your folders

The instructions below are minimal, and are meant to be more as guidelines. We hope you are already pretty comfortable with Git, creating simple HTML pages and using the CLI.

    Step 1:
    Setup your Dev environment

    Use whatever Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Browser you are most comfortable with. We recommend using Google Chrome for its awesome developer tools. As for an IDE, Sublime Text is a good free choice with a lot of online support. Head on over to this tutorial if you're curious.
    Step 2:
    GitHub

    We will be using Git for source and version control. If you are new to Git or want to learn all the details, this a great guide: Git- the simple guide

    Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one and Set it all up.

    Finally, create a GitHub page which is a really easy way to get your 3 HTML pages up and running for us and the world to see :)
    Step 3:
    HTML pages

    Your pages should all connect to each other and try using all of the following tags: section, p, h1, h2, ul, li, img . They should also be stylized using CSS: try adding different colors to each one of your sections, a border around your image and play around with some hover effects. Make sure you are comfortable with using Google Chrome developer tools
    Page 1 : About Me

    Could include a photo, short bio and a list of things you like or enjoy doing. Please include details about your technical background, such as languages you are familiar with, technologies you have worked with etc..
    Page 2 : Mentoring Groups

    Which mentoring group you would like to join, why and what you hope to learn and get out of it.
    Page 3 : Your Projects

    List and describe the projects you have worked on, working on or would like to work on

    Commit all these pages to your GitHub page repository and post the link on the event's page on meetup
    Step 4:
    Command Line (CLI)

    If you are using a Mac you can access command line through Terminal
    If you are using Windows you can access it through PowerShell

    Commands you should be familiar with:

    ls, mkdir, cd, rm, mv, cp, more, less, pwd, find, cat
